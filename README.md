### Interpretable Post-Hoc Machine Learning on the MNIST DATA set.
This project aims provide a set of interpretability methods for deep neural nets. All these methods will be **post-hoc**. This means that we will not used methods that change the model fundamnetally, but instead work with an already trained model that was not designed with interpretability in mind.

#### MNIST DATA
The MNIST data set is a collection of hand-drawn numbers ranging 0 to 9. Each image is black-and-white and has the number centered. The file size is very small, yet extensive enough to do good training. This means that training algorithms execute quickly and there is enough dept in the data to differentiate between well trained models and poorly trained models.
